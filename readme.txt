10/10
- 3/3 Summarizing tweets
- 4/4 Identifying the most popular activities
- 3/3 Adding a text earch interface

Attempted:
- 1/1 Extra Credit - Change one chart on button press instead of making two charts

2. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
20-30ish Hours, my gauging of time is worse due to splitting my attentions between 3 projects and job hunting but it should be around this range.


3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list sites like StackOverflow or specific URLs for tutorials; describe queries to Generative AI or use of AI-based code completion)
Resources:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring
https://stackoverflow.com/
https://www.w3schools.com/js/
https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/

AI Query Descriptions:
    Regex Generation: Asked for regex adjustments or more complicated regex for finding if certain cases existed in tweet data
    Vega: Asked to find certain style options that weren't easily found in docs (Point is a mark option that isn't apparent at first, ended up finding in stack overflow)

No AI Code Completion used, Did use the regular autocomplete for method/variable names though

4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
No classmates or individuals consulted directly. A few questions asked and answered on Slack for clarification like timezones and case sensitivity


5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
Should work with just double clicking the .html files. Tested on Firefox
Formatting should (hopefully) be consistent, indentation inconsistencies may have appeared due to different Prettier settings on my desktop vs laptop
